These three programs help to know the location of the ISS.

The first program tells us the latitude and longitude of the ISS.

The second program tells the country code and timezone in which the ISS currently is. 
The country code may give a response "??" which basically means the ISS is over a region without a specific country association.

The third program tells the latitude and longitude of the ISS at any given date and time.

All of the three programs use wheretheiss.at API and it's variations.
